## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

| Category | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Coq Installation | **FAILED** - Not installed |
| Proof Admits | **FAILED** - 13 admits found |
| Branch Consistency | **PASSED** - Clean working tree |
| Overall | **FAIL** |

## BUILDER Verification (Coq Proofs)

### Environment Status

| Tool | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Coq | **NOT INSTALLED** | `coqc` command not found |
| Compilation | **CANNOT VERIFY** | Blocked by missing Coq |

### File-by-File Audit

| File | Lines Changed | Admits Found | Status |
|------|---------------|--------------|--------|
| `foundations/Syntax.v` | +17/-0 | 0 | **PASS** |
| `foundations/Semantics.v` | +169 | 0 | **PASS** |
| `foundations/Typing.v` | +220/-220 | 0 | **PASS** |
| `type_system/Preservation.v` | +190/-0 | 0 | **PASS** |
| `type_system/Progress.v` | +36/-0 | **13** | **FAIL** |

### Progress.v Admit Details

**Location: `02_FORMAL/coq/type_system/Progress.v`**

| Line | Type | Context |
|------|------|---------|
| 34 | `Admitted.` | `canonical_bool` lemma |
| 44 | `Admitted.` | `canonical_fn` lemma |
| 167 | `admit.` | T_Perform (effects) |
| 170 | `admit.` | T_Handle (handlers) |
| 173 | `admit.` | T_Ref (references) |
| 176 | `admit.` | T_Deref (references) |
| 179 | `admit.` | T_Assign (references) |
| 182 | `admit.` | T_Classify (security) |
| 185 | `admit.` | T_Declassify (security) |
| 188 | `admit.` | T_Prove (security proofs) |
| 191 | `admit.` | T_Require (capabilities) |
| 194 | `admit.` | T_Grant (capabilities) |
| 195 | `Admitted.` | Main `progress` theorem |

**Root Cause:** Operational semantics for effects, references, security, and capabilities are incomplete in `Semantics.v`. The stepping rules exist but the Progress proof cannot proceed because the corresponding typing rule cases require semantic reduction rules that haven't been fully integrated.

## BREAKER Verification

| Metric | Expected | Actual | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| Attack Plan Exists | YES | YES | PASS |
| Coverage Target | All Proofs | In Progress | N/A |

## Cross-Branch Verification

### Branch Inventory

| Branch | Exists | Last Commit |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| main | YES | Synced with origin |
| adversarial | YES | `428e8e7` (current) |
| verification | NO | Not created yet |

### Working Tree Status

**Assessment:** Working tree has uncommitted changes. These need to be committed or stashed before merge operations.

## CRITICAL FINDINGS

### ALERT-001: Progress Theorem Incomplete

**Severity:** HIGH
**Impact:** Type safety cannot be fully proven
**Location:** `Progress.v:74-195`

The Progress theorem has 13 admits covering:
- Effect system (perform/handle)
- Reference operations (ref/deref/assign)
- Security operations (classify/declassify/prove)
- Capability operations (require/grant)

**Required Action:** Complete operational semantics rules in `Semantics.v` or add stepping rules to handle these cases in Progress proof.

### ALERT-002: Coq Not Installed

**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Impact:** Cannot compile or verify ANY proofs
**Location:** System environment

**Required Action:** Install Coq 8.18.0 using setup scripts or system package manager with elevated privileges.

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **IMMEDIATE:** Install Coq to enable proof compilation
2. **HIGH PRIORITY:** Complete Progress.v admits for effect/reference/security cases
3. **MEDIUM:** Commit working tree changes to avoid loss
4. **ONGOING:** Set up automated verification pipeline
