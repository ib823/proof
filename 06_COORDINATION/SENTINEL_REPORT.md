# SENTINEL VERIFICATION REPORT

**Timestamp:** 2026-01-15T09:15:00Z
**Branch Under Verification:** adversarial
**Coq Version:** 8.18.0
**SENTINEL Mode:** ULTRA KIASU | FUCKING PARANOID | ZERO TRUST

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

| Category | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Coq Installation | **PASS** - v8.18.0 installed |
| Committed Code Compiles | **FAIL** |
| Working Tree Compiles | **FAIL** |
| Proof Admits | **FAIL** - 13 admits in Progress.v |
| Overall | **CRITICAL FAIL** |

## CRITICAL FINDING: NO VERSION COMPILES

### Committed Version (HEAD: 417aa2e)

| File | Compilation | Issue |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `foundations/Syntax.v` | **PASS** | - |
| `foundations/Semantics.v` | **PASS** | - |
| `foundations/Typing.v` | **FAIL** | Missing 4 proof cases |
| `type_system/Progress.v` | **BLOCKED** | Depends on Typing.v |
| `type_system/Preservation.v` | **BLOCKED** | Depends on Typing.v |

**Typing.v Error:**
```
File "./foundations/Typing.v", line 233, characters 4-121:
Error: No matching clauses for match.
```

**Root Cause:** The `type_uniqueness` proof has 21 cases but needs 24. Missing cases for:
- T_Unit
- T_Bool
- T_Int
- T_String

The proof starts at T_Var but the induction creates T_Unit as the first goal.

---

### Working Tree (Uncommitted Changes)

| File | Compilation | Issue |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `foundations/Syntax.v` | **PASS** | - |
| `foundations/Semantics.v` | **FAIL** | Determinism proof broken |
| `foundations/Typing.v` | **BLOCKED** | Depends on Semantics.v |

**Semantics.v Error:**
```
File "./foundations/Semantics.v", line 419, characters 4-143:
Error: No matching clauses for match.
```

**Root Cause:** The `step_deterministic` proof has misaligned cases after adding new step rules for effects, references, security, and capabilities. The match tactics fail because the goal structure doesn't match the expected patterns.

---

## PROOF ADMITS AUDIT

### Progress.v (13 admits found)

Even if compilation worked, Progress.v contains incomplete proofs:

| Line | Type | Case |
|------|------|------|
| 34 | `Admitted.` | canonical_bool |
| 44 | `Admitted.` | canonical_fn |
| 167 | `admit.` | T_Perform |
| 170 | `admit.` | T_Handle |
| 173 | `admit.` | T_Ref |
| 176 | `admit.` | T_Deref |
| 179 | `admit.` | T_Assign |
| 182 | `admit.` | T_Classify |
| 185 | `admit.` | T_Declassify |
| 188 | `admit.` | T_Prove |
| 191 | `admit.` | T_Require |
| 194 | `admit.` | T_Grant |
| 195 | `Admitted.` | progress theorem |

## DIFF ANALYSIS

### Changes in Working Tree

| File | Lines Added | Lines Removed |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| Syntax.v | +17 | -0 |
| Semantics.v | +169 | -0 |
| Typing.v | +220 | -220 |
| Preservation.v | +190 | -0 |
| Progress.v | +36 | -0 |

The working tree adds:
- New step rules for effects, refs, security, capabilities (Semantics.v)
- Missing T_Unit/Bool/Int/String cases (Typing.v)
- Extended proofs (Preservation.v, Progress.v)

But the Semantics.v `step_deterministic` proof is broken.

---

## COMPILATION MATRIX

```
                    COMMITTED    WORKING TREE
Syntax.v            PASS         PASS
Semantics.v         PASS         FAIL
Typing.v            FAIL         BLOCKED
Progress.v          BLOCKED      BLOCKED
Preservation.v      BLOCKED      BLOCKED
```

**CONCLUSION:** Neither version can produce a verified proof.

---

## REQUIRED ACTIONS

### Immediate (BLOCKING)

1. **Fix Typing.v (committed):** Add missing 4 cases for T_Unit, T_Bool, T_Int, T_String
2. **Fix Semantics.v (working tree):** Repair step_deterministic proof for new step rules
3. **Complete Progress.v:** Remove all 13 admits

### Before Any Merge

1. All .v files must compile with `coqc`
2. `grep -r "Admitted\|admit\." *.v` must return empty
3. Full coqchk verification pass

## BRANCH STATUS

| Branch | Merge Status |
|--------|--------------|
| adversarial → main | **BLOCKED** |
| verification → main | **BLOCKED** |

## VERIFICATION COMMANDS

```bash
# Clean build (run from 02_FORMAL/coq/)
rm -f foundations/*.vo* type_system/*.vo* effects/*.vo* properties/*.vo*
coqc -Q . TERAS foundations/Syntax.v
coqc -Q . TERAS foundations/Semantics.v
coqc -Q . TERAS foundations/Typing.v
coqc -Q . TERAS type_system/Progress.v
coqc -Q . TERAS type_system/Preservation.v

# Check for admits
grep -rn "Admitted\|admit\." *.v
```

---

**SENTINEL VERDICT: CRITICAL FAIL**

*No version of the codebase produces verified proofs.*
*Merge to main is BLOCKED until all issues resolved.*
