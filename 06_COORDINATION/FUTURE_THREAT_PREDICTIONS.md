## UNKNOWN UNKNOWNS METHODOLOGY

To address threats we cannot currently conceive:

### Defense Architecture Patterns

1. **Defense in Depth:** Multiple independent layers (A→R→S→T→U)
2. **Fail-Secure:** Unknown threats trigger halt, not bypass
3. **Redundancy:** N-modular redundancy detects arbitrary corruption
4. **Minimal TCB:** Reduce attack surface to auditable minimum

### Discovery Methodologies

1. **Hardware Evolution Monitoring:** Track new CPU/memory architectures
2. **Academic Literature Scanning:** Monitor security conferences
3. **Attack Database Analysis:** Pattern recognition on CVE/CWE evolution
4. **Adversarial Red Teaming:** BREAKER continuously attacks

### Emerging Attack Surface Indicators

Watch for threats when:
- New computing paradigms emerge (quantum, neuromorphic, biological)
- New interconnect technologies appear (CXL, UCIe)
- New memory technologies deploy (persistent memory, CXL)
- New optimization techniques appear (AI-assisted compilation)

---

## CONCLUSION

**Tracks R/S/T/U are architecturally sound but have ZERO PROOFS.**

The threat predictions in this document identify attack vectors that:
- Are extrapolated from historical attack evolution
- Are projected from emerging technology analysis
- Require proofs that DO NOT YET EXIST

**Immediate Priority:** Fix Track A foundations (BREAKER findings) before starting R/S/T/U.
